## 🎯 WHAT IS IT?

**THE BLACKOUT ENGINE** is a full-scale, military-grade DDoS simulation and saturation testing platform. It combines tactical precision with a stylized GenZ interface, TLS deception, WAF evasion, adaptive fire rates, and real-time analytics. This isn't just a stress test; this is a **flood engine built for the next era of cyber offense.** 💥

## ⚙️ USAGE (SO SIMPLE. SO BRUTAL.)

### For Windows Users 🖥️:
1.  **Download as ZIP:** Get the project archive.
2.  **Download Python:** Install Python on your system.
3.  **Add Python to Path:** Ensure Python is accessible from your command line.
4.  **Execute the following commands in your terminal:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python blackoutengine.py
    ```

### For Linux Users 🐧:
1.  **Run the following commands in your terminal:**
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install iptables macchanger python3 git
    git clone [https://github.com/yourname/blackout-engine](https://github.com/yourname/blackout-engine)
    cd blackout-engine
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python blackoutengine.py
    ```

### Configuration Options 🛠️:
* 🔫 **Enter primary target domain or IP:** Specify your target.
* ➕ **Add more targets?** Option to include multiple targets.
* ⏱️ **Set attack duration:** Define how long the attack should run.
* 🔁 **Set threads:** Configure the number of concurrent threads.
* 💥 **Firepower rate per thread:** Adjust the intensity per thread.
* 📡 **Choose method: GET / POST / HEAD:** Select your HTTP method.
* 🔬 **Enable payload expansions?** Option to use expanded payloads.
* 📡 **Enable HTTP/2 spoofing?** Activate HTTP/2 protocol spoofing.
* 🧠 **Enable auto-fire tuning?** Allow the engine to dynamically adjust fire rates.
* 🛡️ **Run WAF fingerprint scan?** Perform a Web Application Firewall detection.
* 👻 **Anonymize host before launch?** Mask your origin.
* 🎯 **Target OS? windows / linux / generic:** Specify the target's operating system for optimized attacks.

### 💡 COMPANION TOOL: DEAD SIGNALS 🛰️
[https://github.com/thehackingprotocol/Dead-Signal](https://github.com/thehackingprotocol/Dead-Signal)

While BLACKOUT attacks are running, Dead Signals allows you to monitor real-time ping and signal loss on the target.

#### Why use it? 🔍
* 📡 **Dead Signals sends a ping every second.**
* 📉 **Detects when the server dies or recovers mid-strike.**
* 🔗 **Run it in a second terminal for live visual confirmation.**

## 🔥 FEATURES (EVERYTHING THAT MATTERS)

* ⚡ **Max Saturation Engine:** Fully multi-threaded with up to 250 RPS × 100+ threads for extreme performance.
* 🧠 **Auto-Fire Tuning:** Dynamically adjusts attack rate based on 403/429 responses.
* ☁️ **WAF Bypass:** Fingerprints and sidesteps common Web Application Firewalls like Cloudflare, AWS, Azure, etc.
* 🧬 **TLS Fingerprint Spoofing:** Randomizes JA3 and User-Agent headers to evade detection.
* 🍪 **Payload Mutation Engine:** Rotates cookies, headers, and referrers for persistent attacks.
* 🛡️ **Anonymity Layer:** Includes MAC spoofing, IP reset, and history wiping.
* 📊 **Live Graph Telemetry:** Provides real-time success/failure/time metrics in the terminal.
* 💣 **Modular OS Flooding:** Offers separate modes for Windows, Linux, and generic stack-specific attacks.
* 👁️ **Interactive CLI:** Features rainbow prompts, figlet headers, and a stylish user interface.
* 🔥 **Self-deletion Mode:** Destroys traces after execution for stealth operations.
