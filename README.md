## 🎯 WHAT IS IT?

**THE BLACKOUT ENGINE** is a full-scale military-grade DDoS simulation and saturation testing platform.  
It combines tactical precision with stylized GenZ interface, TLS deception, WAF evasion, adaptive fire rate, and real-time analytics.  
This isn't a stress test. This is a **flood engine built for the next era of cyber offense.**

---

## ⚙️ USAGE (SO SIMPLE. SO BRUTAL.)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/blackout-engine
cd blackout-engine
pip install -r requirements.txt
python blackoutengine.py

🔫 Enter primary target domain or IP:
➕ Add more targets?
⏱️ Set attack duration:
🔁 Set threads:
💥 Firepower rate per thread:
📡 Choose method: GET / POST / HEAD
🔬 Enable payload expansions?
📡 Enable HTTP/2 spoofing?
🧠 Enable auto-fire tuning?
🛡️ Run WAF fingerprint scan?
👻 Anonymize host before launch?
🎯 Target OS? windows / linux / generic

💡 COMPANION TOOL: DEAD SIGNALS : https://github.com/thehackingprotocol/Dead-Signal-
While BLACKOUT attacks, Dead Signals lets you monitor real-time ping and signal loss on the target.

🔍 Why use it?

📡 Dead Signals sends ping every second

📉 Detects when the server dies or recovers mid-strike

🔗 Run it in a second terminal for live visual confirmation
