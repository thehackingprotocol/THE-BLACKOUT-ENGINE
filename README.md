     THE BLACKOUT ENGINE
       by The Hacking Protocol // Powered by KHORA
📡 Supercharge Monitoring with “Dead Signal” at https://github.com/thehackingprotocol/Dead-Signal-
While BLACKOUT unleashes full-scale traffic, you’ll want real-time visibility. Dead Signal is a lightweight ping-based monitor that tracks latency and availability by sending pings every second—keeping you updated on whether your strikes are hitting or if endpoints recover mid-flood.

⚡ Stays ahead of firewalls with live ICMP tracking

🔁 Perfect companion to detect drops or rebounds during an attack

🔄 Integrates easily; run it in parallel with BLACKOUT for full coverage


THE BLACKOUT ENGINE isn't just a DDoS simulator —
It's a cyberstrike protocol.
It's an AI-directed flood beast.
It's a command-line war machine for the modern red teamer, built with full GenZ CLI energy.

If you're tired of boring tools, broken scripts, or outdated payloads —
Welcome to the future. This is where packets go full tactical.

🔍 FEATURES (DETAILED + JUICED)
💡 Feature	🔥 Description
⚙️ Interactive CLI	Every action prompts YOU. No flags. Just vibes. You’re in control.
🎨 Banner UI + GenZ Colors	Live animated banners, rainbow prompts, styled inputs. Looks good. Hits hard.
🧠 AI-Auto Fire Tuning	KHORA monitors HTTP 403/429 responses and tunes request rate on-the-fly. No burnouts. No blocks.
🔥 Peak Flood Threading	Push up to 250 RPS x 100+ threads. That’s over 25k/sec from one node.
☁️ WAF Fingerprint Scanner	Cloudflare? AWS? Akamai? It’ll tell you who’s protecting what before you hit it.
🛡️ TLS + JA3 Spoofing	Masks your packets with randomized TLS client hello profiles. Kills WAF signatures.
🍪 Header & Cookie Bombs	Injects thousands of unique headers, cookies, referers. Payloads mutate every call.
🐧🪟 OS-Specific Payloads	Separate logic cores for Linux and Windows target surfaces. No generic packets here.
📊 Live Graph Telemetry	See successes, fails, saturation rate — all in real time, plotted in terminal.
👻 Anonymity Engine	MAC spoofing, IP trickery, history wipe, even shell self-delete. You're a ghost.
🔁 Target Rotator	Hit multiple domains/IPs one after the other with auto-load.
💣 Modular & Extendable	Add TOR fallback, raw TCP, or auto-rules with zero core edits. KHORA doesn’t lock you in.

⚙️ HOW TO USE (FULL WALKTHROUGH)
No flags. Just launch. It talks to you.

git clone https://github.com/thehackingprotocol/THE-BLACKOUT-ENGINE
cd THE-BLACKOUT-ENGINE
pip install -r requirements.txt
python blackoutengine.py

You'll be prompted:

🔫 Enter primary target domain or IP:
➕ Add another target? (Y/n)
⏱️ Duration in seconds:
🔁 Thread count:
💥 Firepower rate per thread:
📡 HTTP Method? GET / POST / HEAD
🔬 Enable payload expansions?
📡 Enable HTTP/2 mode?
🧠 Enable auto-tune mode?
🛡️ Scan for WAF?
👻 Anonymize before launch?
🎯 Target OS? windows / linux / generic
✅ KHORA handles all logic from there. Sit back and watch the graph light up.
